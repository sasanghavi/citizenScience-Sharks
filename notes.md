* Backdrop of "fossil soil" like that from Aurora dig (randomly selected)
* Scatter 20-25 shark teeth randomly around the image
    * Random types/sizes
        * 15-20 different species, 2-3 "families" (bullshark, maeko, etc.)
    * "Bury" them?
* Teeth and image should be scaled to approximate real size
* User finds and clicks on shark teeth, which will remove them from the screen and place them in a "basket" (sidebar?)
    * User can see "You have found X out of Y shark teeth"
    * User can zoom in on parts of the image?
* After the user finds (all / X% of) the shark teeth, user can proceed on to the next step
    * Automatically or by choice?
* User can measure teeth using a measurement card or variable-sized circle measure tool
* User can classify teeth by family
* User proceeds to next page where they can see statistics
    * Size distribution (histogram?)
* User should be able to go back to original page at any time and find more teeth (if some are left)
* User should be able to replay with a new backdrop / set of teeth

Unknowns

* Linear measurements?
* Learning modules?
* Measure new teeth?
* OpenCV processing on teeth for scaling / processing / measuring?

Technologies

* Python
* Flask
